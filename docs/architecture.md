# Dynamics 365 F&SCM - System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the system architecture for a Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Supply Chain Management implementation supporting enterprise operations.

## System Components

### Core Dynamics 365 Modules
- **Finance Management**: General ledger, accounts payable/receivable, budgeting, fixed assets
- **Supply Chain Management**: Inventory management, procurement, warehouse operations
- **Production Control**: Manufacturing execution, production planning, BOM management
- **Sales & Marketing**: Order management, pricing, customer relationship management

### Technical Architecture

#### Application Tier
- Dynamics 365 F&SCM Cloud Environment (Production)
- Sandbox Environment (Testing/UAT)
- Development Environment (Customization)

#### Data Tier
- Azure SQL Database (Primary)
- Data Lake Storage for analytics
- Azure Blob Storage for document management

#### Integration Layer
- Azure Logic Apps for system integrations
- Data Management Framework (DMF) for data import/export
- OData/REST APIs for real-time integrations
- Azure Service Bus for asynchronous messaging

### External System Integrations

#### Integrated Systems
1. **SAP Legacy System** - Master data synchronization
2. **Salesforce CRM** - Customer and opportunity data
3. **Third-party Logistics (3PL)** - Shipping and tracking
4. **Banking System** - Payment processing and reconciliation
5. **Power BI** - Real-time dashboards and reporting

#### Integration Methods
- **Real-time**: REST APIs, OData endpoints
- **Batch**: Data Management Framework, scheduled jobs
- **Event-driven**: Azure Service Bus, webhooks

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- Azure Active Directory (SSO integration)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Network Security
- Virtual Network (VNet) isolation
- Private endpoints for database connections
- Azure Firewall rules and NSGs
- VPN/ExpressRoute for on-premises connectivity

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest (TDE - Transparent Data Encryption)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+)
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies

## High Availability & Disaster Recovery

### Availability
- 99.9% SLA (Microsoft-managed)
- Multi-region deployment capability
- Automatic failover for database
- Load balancing across instances

### Backup Strategy
- **Automated backups**: Daily full backups, transaction log backups every 15 minutes
- **Retention**: 30 days for production, 7 days for sandbox
- **Point-in-time recovery**: Up to 35 days
- **Geo-redundant storage**: Secondary region backup

### Disaster Recovery
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 15 minutes
- **DR Site**: Secondary Azure region
- **Failover process**: Documented and tested quarterly

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Index maintenance schedules
- Query performance monitoring
- Partitioning strategy for large tables
- Archive old transactional data

### Application Optimization
- Batch job scheduling (off-peak hours)
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Resource throttling for intensive operations

## Monitoring & Observability

### Monitoring Tools
- Azure Monitor for infrastructure metrics
- Application Insights for application telemetry
- Dynamics 365 Lifecycle Services (LCS) monitoring
- Custom alerts for critical operations

### Key Metrics Tracked
- System availability and uptime
- Response time and performance
- Batch job success rates
- Integration success/failure rates
- User session metrics
- Database performance (DTU/CPU usage)

## Compliance & Governance

### Standards Compliance
- ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)
- GDPR (Data Privacy)
- SOC 2 Type II
- Industry-specific regulations

### Audit & Logging
- All user actions logged
- Administrative changes tracked
- 90-day audit log retention
- Quarterly compliance reviews
